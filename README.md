Project Name: TalkToAnyone
Description: TalkToAnyone is an app that helps people who speak different languages talk to each other. It turns what they say into text, translates it into the other person's language, and reads it out loud so both can understand each other easily. The app makes it simple for anyone to connect, no matter what language they speak.
Note: In order to see the interfaces, you must run the code yourself.
